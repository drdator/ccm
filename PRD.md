# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## CCM - Claude Command Manager

### Document Information
- **Product Name**: CCM (Claude Command Manager)
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: January 2025
- **Status**: Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

CCM (Claude Command Manager) is a package manager for Claude Code custom slash commands. Similar to how NPM manages JavaScript packages and pip manages Python packages, CCM provides a centralized system for discovering, sharing, and managing Claude Code custom commands. It integrates seamlessly with Claude Code's existing command infrastructure (`.claude/commands/`), adding version management and community sharing capabilities to enhance the Claude Code ecosystem.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **No Standardized Command Management**: Users working with Claude AI lack a unified system to manage, share, and version control their commands and prompts
- **Repetitive Work**: Users often recreate similar commands and workflows without a way to save and reuse them
- **No Community Sharing**: No established mechanism for the community to share effective Claude commands and best practices
- **Version Control Issues**: Difficulty in tracking changes and maintaining different versions of Claude commands
- **Integration Complexity**: No standard way to integrate Claude commands into existing development workflows

### Opportunity
Create a dedicated command management system that brings the convenience and ecosystem benefits of package managers to the Claude AI user community.

## 3. Goals & Objectives
